Improve your self confidence on the go (this is the landing page)

# what is Better
We made Better at the Product Hunt London hackathon in November 2015.

A lot of people struggle with self confidence issues, and especially in the UK it is hard to be open about this issue and get help from people.

Better is an app that sets you daily challenges to improve your interactions with strangers. This format of "gradually increasing difficulty" is known as exposure therapy.
